To get from San Francisco International Airport (SFO) to Stanford University, you have several transportation options, including public transit, driving, rideshare, and shuttle services. Here's an overview:

### Public Transit

1. **BART to Caltrain:**
   - Take the BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) from SFO to the Millbrae Station. BART stations are located in the International Terminal and can be accessed via AirTrain from other terminals.
   - At Millbrae, transfer to the Caltrain heading towards San Jose or Gilroy.
   - Get off at the Palo Alto Station or the California Ave Station, which are the closest Caltrain stations to Stanford.
   - From there, you can take the free Stanford Marguerite Shuttle, bike, walk, or use a rideshare service to reach the campus.

### Driving or Rideshare

1. **Driving/Rideshare (e.g., Uber, Lyft):**
   - The drive from SFO to Stanford typically takes about 30-45 minutes, depending on traffic.
   - The most direct route is via US-101 South. Exit onto University Avenue westbound, which leads directly into Stanford.

### Shuttle Services

1. **Shared Van Services:**
   - Companies like SuperShuttle offer shared or private rides from SFO to Stanford. It's advisable to book in advance.

### Considerations

- Public transit might take longer but is generally more cost-effective.
- Driving or rideshare offers more convenience and flexibility but can be more expensive, especially during peak traffic hours.
- Always check the latest schedules and road conditions before you travel, as they can affect your journey time.
