    "What is the eternal reliance of the hometown, we do not know, we only know that because of people, the hometown never withers. This is a sentence in the vision of the foundation, which reveals that volunteers in the foundation organization become the backbone of the structure through the transmission operation of the board of directors, the volunteer group, and the secretariat. The foundation's volunteer group has four types of organizations: the 'Wenjiao Small Volunteer' of junior high school students, the 'High School Volunteer' composed of high school students, the 'Xin Gangyi' from the college youth association, and the adult volunteer group. The four-stage organization is passed down in one vein, forming a close inheritance and public participation network. Through community participation, visit learning, and interactive fellowship, the volunteers of the foundation are always full of energy and motivation, ready to go, and sustainable. It is hoped that the people of Laoshi Village will increase their identification and public affairs participation in their hometown through the process of personal participation.",

    "什么是故乡永远的依靠，我们不知道，我们只知道，因为人，故乡永不凋谢。希望义工在未来的社区发展基金组织中，透过董事会、志工团、秘书处的传动运作成为架构中的骨干。本会义工团有小初高中生的「小义工」、大学生组成的「高校义工」、来自青年会的「地方谊」、以及成人大义工，四种阶段组织一脉相传，形成紧密的传承及公共参与网络。透过社区参与、参访学习、互动联谊，使本会义工随时充满能量动力而蓄势待发，永续不坠。期盼海头乡亲藉由亲自参与的过程，彼此学习与合作，增加对故乡的认同及公共事务参与力。",
